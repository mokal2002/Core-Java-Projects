# Hospital Management System

A simple console-based Hospital Management System developed in Core Java using MySQL and JDBC. This system manages patients, doctors, and appointments, providing basic CRUD functionalities.

## Features

- **Add Patient**: Register a new patient by entering their name, age, and gender.
- **View Patients**: Display a list of all patients with their details.
- **View Doctors**: Display a list of all doctors along with their specializations.
- **Book Appointment**: Schedule an appointment between a patient and a doctor for a specified date.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core Java for application logic.
- **JDBC**: For connecting and interacting with the MySQL database.
- **MySQL**: Database to store patient, doctor, and appointment data.

## Project Structure

- **`config`**: Contains the `AppConstants` class for database configuration.
- **`service`**: Contains service classes (`DoctorService` and `PatientService`) that handle business logic.
- **`validation`**: Includes the `valid` class for input validation.
- **`HospitalManagementSystem.java`**: The main class that drives the application.

## Database Schema

- **Doctor Table**: 
  - `id`: INT, Primary Key
  - `name`: VARCHAR(255)
  - `specialization`: VARCHAR(255)

- **Patient Table**:
  - `id`: INT, Primary Key
  - `name`: VARCHAR(255)
  - `age`: INT
  - `gender`: VARCHAR(50)

- **Appointments Table**:
  - `id`: INT, Primary Key
  - `patient_id`: INT, Foreign Key references `Patient(id)`
  - `doctor_id`: INT, Foreign Key references `Doctor(id)`
  - `appointment_date`: DATE
